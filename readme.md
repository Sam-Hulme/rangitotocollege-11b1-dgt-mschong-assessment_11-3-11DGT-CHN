## Note when running games
Run `menu.py` only, running other files will either crash or do nothing.

Make sure to open the python folder from the repository root folder to ensure files are written and read to the right place.

Do (from command line):
```
cd Python/
python menu.py
```

Don't:
```
python Python/menu.py
```



you can see my sanity degrading over time in the comments and commit logs lol

*i wouldn't run tk.py if you have unsaved things*
